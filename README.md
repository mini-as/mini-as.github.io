What is minis:

minis is small operating system, designed to work on 
computer with processor intel (80386) or better.
written by me as hobby for fun and learning how
computers work.

minis assembler also written by me, I used to compile minis OS, and I make it as simple
as possible and small.

I hope you enjoy :-)

Info:

Inside the Archive "minis.rar" you will find minis assembler and minis operating system, you need WinRAR archiver to open it.

All Tools I used to build and test Minis OS and Minis Assembler run under windows operating system.
I used fasm Assembler to compile Minis Assembler, Which in turn I used to compile minis operating system, and I use bosch pc emulator to test the Minis OS.
